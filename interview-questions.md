5. What is the difference between a function and a method?
From Shaun
Your answer:A function is a set of instructions in code to do a task. Methods are the means inside of the function that you get the function to do the task.

Researched answer: Both functions and methods are used to define blocks of reusable code that performs specific tasks, but they do have key differences. Functions are indepentent blocks of code that can be defined and called anywhere within a program. Methods are functions that are associated with objects or classes. They are defined within the scope of an object or class and are meant to operate on that specific object's data. Methods are typically called on an object or class instance using dot notation. They often work with the object's properties and perform actions related to that object's context.
